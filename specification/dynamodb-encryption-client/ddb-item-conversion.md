The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

## Overview

This document describes how a DynamoDB Item is converted
to the Structured Encryption Library's [Structured Data](../structured-encryption/structures.md#structured-data),
and vice versa.

The conversion from DDB Item to Structured Data must be lossless,
meaning that converting a DDB Item to
a Structured Data and back to a DDB Item again
MUST result in the exact same DDB Item.

## Convert DDB Item to Structured Data

A [Structured Data](../structured-encryption/structures.md#structured-data)
converted from a DynamoDB Item has the following requirements:
- MUST be a [Structured Data Map](../structured-encryption/structures.md#structured-data-map).
- MUST NOT have [Structured Data Attributes](../structured-encryption/structures.md#structured-data-attributes).
- MUST contain a [Structured Data Terminal](../structured-encryption/structures.md#structured-data-terminal)
  for each attribute on the DynamoDB Item,
  such that:
  - the [Terminal Type ID](../structured-encryption/structures.md#terminal-type-id)
    is the [Type ID](./ddb-attribute-serialization.md#type-id) of the [serialization](./ddb-attribute-serialization.md) of this Attribute Value.
  - the [Terminal Value](../structured-encryption/structures.md#termin-value)
    is the [Value](./ddb-attribute-serialization.md#type-id) of the [serialization](./ddb-attribute-serialization.md) of this Attribute Value.
  - The Structured Data Terminal is located at the top level of the Structured Data,
    string indexed by the Attribute Name.
- MUST NOT contain any additional [Structured Data](../structured-encryption/structures.md#structured-data)
  than those specified above.

## Convert Structured Data to DDB Item

In order to convert to a DynamoDB Item,
[Structured Data](../structured-encryption/structures.md#structured-data)
adheres to the following:
- MUST be a [Structured Data Map](../structured-encryption/structures.md#structured-data-map).
- This [Structured Data Map](../structured-encryption/structures.md#structured-data-map),
  if not empty,
  MUST only contain [Structured Data Terminals](../structured-encryption/structures.md#structured-data-terminal).
- This [Structured Data Map](../structured-encryption/structures.md#structured-data-map)
  MUST NOT contain any [Structured Data](../structured-encryption/structures.md#structured-data)
  at index "TODO:header".
- This [Structured Data Map](../structured-encryption/structures.md#structured-data-map)
  MUST NOT contain any [Structured Data](../structured-encryption/structures.md#structured-data)
  at index "TODO:footer".
- MUST NOT have [Structured Data Attributes](../structured-encryption/structures.md#structured-data-attributes).

A DynamoDB Item converted from a
[Structured Data](../structured-encryption/structures.md#structured-data)
has the following requirements:
- MUST contain an Attribute for every [Structured Data Terminal](../structured-encryption/structures.md#structured-data-terminal)
  on the Structured Data,
  such that:
  - The Attribute is the deserialization of the concatenation of
    `Terminal Type ID | Terminal Value`,
    according to [the serialization scheme](./ddb-attribute-serialization.md).
- MUST contain a Binary Attribute with Attribute Name "TODO:header".
- MUST contain a Binary Attribute with Attribute Name "TODO:footer".
- MUST NOT contain any Attribute not specified above.
