# Structured Encryption Footer

## Overview

The footer is a special [Terminal Data](./structures.md#terminal-data)
that exists on encrypted [Structured Data](./structures.md#structured-data)
in order to store signatures over signed fields in that structured data.

## Signed Fields

When encrypting, `signed fields` refers to all fields for which the
[Crypto Schema](./structures.md#crypto-schema) indicates `ENCRYPT_AND_SIGN` or `SIGN_ONLY`.

When decrypting `signed fields` refers to all fields for which the
the [Authenticate Schema](#authenticate-schema) indicates `SIGN`

## Footer Format

The [Terminal Value](./structures.md#terminal-value) of the footer MUST be

| Field | Length (bytes) | Interpreted as |
| ----- | -------------- | -------------- |
| [Recipient Tags](#recipient-tags) | Variable. 48 bytes per Encrypted Data Key in the header | Bytes |
| [Signature](#signature) | 0 or 96 | Signature, if signatures are enabled |

### Canonical Hash

A canonical hash is calculated for the encrypted form of a record.
This hash is used to calculate the HMACs and Signature.

#### Canonical Field

##### Canonical Encrypted Field

The canonical form of an encrypted field MUST be
| Field | Length (bytes) | Interpreted as |
| ----- | -------------- | -------------- |
| The [canonical path](./header.md#canonical-path) of the field name | Variable | Bytes |
| encrypted data length - 2 | 8 | 64-bit integer |
| "ENCRYPTED" | 9 | Literal Ascii text |
| TypeID | 2 | the type ID of the unencrypted Terminal |
| value | Variable | the encrypted Terminal value |

The original data length of an encrypted field will be two less than its encrypted form
because the encrypted form starts with the two byte unencrypted data type;
so by using 2 less than the encrypted data length, we are using the original data length.

##### Canonical Plaintext Field

The canonical form of a plaintext field MUST be
| Field | Length (bytes) | Interpreted as |
| ----- | -------------- | -------------- |
| The [canonical path](./header.md#canonical-path) of the field name | Variable | Bytes |
| data length | 8 | 64-bit integer |
| "PLAINTEXT" | 9 | Literal Ascii text |
| TypeID | 2 | the type ID of the Terminal |
| value | Variable | the Terminal value |

#### Canonical Record

The canonical form of a record MUST be
| Field | Length (bytes) | Interpreted as |
| ----- | -------------- | -------------- |
| header | Variable | The full serialized header with commitment |
| AAD Length | 8 | 64-bit integer, the length of the following AAD data |
| AAD | Variable | The serialization of the Encryption Context from the Encryption Materials |
| Field Data | Variable | For each [signed field](#signed-fields), ordered lexicographically by [canonical path](./header.md#canonical-path), the [canonical field](#canonical-field). |

#### Hash Calculation

The canonical hash of a record MUST be the SHA384 of the canonical form of the record.

### Recipient Tags

There MUST be one Recipient Tag for each Encrypted Data Key in the [header](./header.md#encrypted-data-keys)

The encryption materials provide a list of encrypted data keys,
and an associated list of symmetricSigningKeys,
representing authorized recipients.

the Recipient Tag MUST be MUST be calculated over the [Canonical Hash](#canonical-hash)
using the [symmetric signature algorithm](../../submodules/MaterialProviders/aws-encryption-sdk-specification/framework/algorithm-suites.md#algorithm-suites-signature-settings)
indicated in the algorithm suite,
and the
[symmetric signing keys](../../submodules/MaterialProviders/aws-encryption-sdk-specification/framework/structures.md#symmetric-signing-keys)
in the encryption materials.

the HMAC values MUST have the same order as the
[symmetric signing keys](../../submodules/MaterialProviders/aws-encryption-sdk-specification/framework/structures.md#symmetric-signing-keys)
used to calculate them.

## Signature

The signature MUST be included in the footer if the flavor
in the [header](./header.md#format-flavor) is 0x01
and MUST NOT be included in the footer if the flavor
in the [header](./header.md#format-flavor) is 0x00.

The `signature`, if it exists, MUST be calculated over the [Canonical Hash](#canonical-hash),
using the asymmetric signing key in the encryption materials.

The `signature`, if it exists, MUST be calculated using the
[asymmetric signature algorithm](../../submodules/MaterialProviders/aws-encryption-sdk-specification/framework/algorithm-suites.md#algorithm-suites-signature-settings)
indicated by the algorithm suite.

## Footer Verification

The footer is verified before it's record is decrypted. 

### Recipient Tag Verification

Verification MUST fail unless at least one of the [Recipient Tags](#recipient-tags)
matches a calculated recipient tag using the provided symmetricSigningKey.
Recipient Tag comparisons MUST be constant time operations.

### Signature Verification

If the footer contains a signature, this signature MUST be verified using the
[asymmetric signature algorithm](../../submodules/MaterialProviders/aws-encryption-sdk-specification/framework/algorithm-suites.md#algorithm-suites-signature-settings)
indicated by the algorithm suite.
