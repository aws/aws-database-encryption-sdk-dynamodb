# DynamoDB Beacons

## Version

1.0.0

### Changelog

## Definitions

 * gazelle prefix : `aws-ddbec-`
 * beacon prefix : `aws-ddbec-sb-`
 * source field : an encrypted DynamoDB attribute
 * beacon field : an attribute holding the truncated HMAC of a source field,
as defined [here](beacons.md).
The name of the beacon field is the concatenation of
the beacon prefix and the source field name.

### Conventions used in this document

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

### Overview

A `DynamoDBTableEncryptionConfig` object provides the list of Beacons
for the table associated with an operation,
and other necessary configuration information.

Various Request and Response objects are transformed, based on this configuration.

It should be noted that primary keys cannot be scan beacons,
both because primary keys are not encrypted
and because scan becaons are designed to create false duplicates.

The basic user experience is this 
1. User constructs a client object, registering Gazelle intercepts
2. User calls client methods as normal
3. Gazelle interceptors might call one of the below functions to transform a request, then encrypts the request as necessary.
4. Gazelle interceptors decrypt the response as necessary, then might call one of the functions below to transform the response.
5. User receives the response.

#### Indexing

When a request is made to create a Index for a source field,
instead the index must be created on the scan beacon field.

When the projection contains a source field, the scan beacon field is also included in the projection.

It can be dangerous to specify a projection other than ALL,
because decryption requires the presense of all signed fields
that were present when the record was written.

Users might create tables and/or indexes in the console. In this case,
they must be well educated to perform these same transformations by hand.

#### Writing

Whenever a record is written, if the source field is written then the scan beacon field must also be written.
That is, for every encrypted attribute with a scan beacon, an additional attribute is written.

It is an error to attempt to write a source attribute starting with the gazelle prefix.

#### Reading

To retrieve a record based on the value of an encrypted source field,
search instead for the hash of the value in the scan beacon field.

 * With no beacon, and encrypted attribute cannot be searched.
 * With plain beacons, only exact matches can be supported.
 * compound beacons with a prefix can support ranged queries such as `between` and `begins_with`.
 * compound beacons with a split can support `contains`

It is an error to attempt a query with an unsupported operation.

Because beacons might be truncated, these queries might return false positive results.
After retrieving records in this way,
you examine the decrypted record and compare the source field values to the query values,
and discard any records where they don't match.

### Configuration

In addition to the configuration supplied for each [beacon](beacons.md),
the following OPTIONAL configuration MUST be supported

 * The **Primary Key Parts** : The name of the primary key for the table,
the partition and optional sort key to be used to create this key,
and the [Key Indicator](./beacons.md#key-indicator) used to generate the HMAC.
See [transformPutItemInput](#transformPutItemInput)
 * The **LSI Style** : For each Local Secondary Index, if it should be handled in WIDE or NARROW mode.
(see [transformCreateTableInput](#transformCreateTableInput)

## Operations

#### Note : The object types below are referred to by the Dafny names generated by Polymorph

### transformCreateTableInput

 * This operation MUST take a CreateTableInput object as input.
 * This operation MUST return a CreateTableInput object.
 * This operation MUST return an error if any part of the input
object mentions an attribute name starting with the `gazelle prefix`.
 * If no indexes are being created, and the Primary Key Parts are not configured,
the CreateTableInput object MUST be returned unaltered.
 * If the Primary Key Parts are configured
 * * If no primary key is specified in the input, then a primary key
of the given name and type `Binary` must be added to the input.

 * * otherwise, that field must be changed to be the beacon field, and its type changed to string.
 * If a Global Secondary Index is being created that has an explicit list
of attributes in its projection
 * * if an encrypted field is in its projection, and that field has a beacon configured,
then that beacon must be added to the projection.
 * * if an encrypted field was mentioned in the Key Configuration, then that
encrypted field must be added to the projection.

 * If a Local Secondary Index, explicitly configured as NARROW,
is being created that has an explicit list of attributes in its projection,
and an encrypted field is in its projection, and that field has a beacon configured,
then that field MUST be replaces by its beacon in the projection.
 * If a Local Secondary Index, not explicitly configured as NARROW,
is being created that has an explicit list of attributes in its projection,
 * * if an encrypted field is in its projection, and that field has a beacon configured,
then that beacon MUST also be included in the projection.

the UpdateTableInput object MUST be returned unaltered.

 * If the Global Secondary Index being created references
an encrypted field in its Key Configuration,
 * * if that field does not have a beacon configured, this operation MUST return an error.

 * This operation MUST return an error if any part of the input
object mentions an attribute name starting with the `gazelle prefix`.

 * If the Primary Key Parts are configured
 * * If the primary key is present in the item's attributes, this operation
MUST return an error.
 * * If either the partition or sort key are missing from the input attributes,
this operation MUST return an error; otherwise,
 * * if only a primary key is specified, then an HMAC384 must be generated from it; otherwise,
 * * an HMAC384 must be generated from the concatenation of the partition key,
a literal `_` character, and the sort key.
 * * This HMAC value must be added to the item's attributes.
 * If the input object refers to an encrypted attribute in its Condition Expression,
in any context other than `attribute_exists`, `attribute_not_exists` or `size`,

 * This operation MUST return a TransactWriteItemsInput object.
 * Each item MUST be handled as outlined above in transformPutItemInput

#### Note : GetItem, BatchGetItem and TransactGetItems work only on Primary Keys, and therefore are not affected by scan beacons

#### Note PartiQL based methods (executeStatement, batchExecuteStatement, executeTransaction) are beyond the scope of this document.

#### Note : UpdateItem is only allowed to modify unsigned attributes, so we only need to test for the presence of signed attributes, we don't need to modify the request.

### transformUpdateItemInput
 * This operation MUST take as input an UpdateItemInput
 * This operation MUST return the unmodified input object
 * This operation MUST return an error if any part of the input
object mentions an attribute name starting with the `gazelle prefix`.
 * This operation MUST return an error if the input object is attempting to modify a signed attribute.
 * If the input object refers to an encrypted attribute in its Condition Expression,
in any context other than `attribute_exists`, `attribute_not_exists` or `size`,
this operation MUST return an error.

### transformQueryInput
 * This operation MUST take as input a QueryInput object.
 * This operation MUST return a list of QueryInput objects
 * If no source fields are mentioned, this operstion MUST return a single QueryInput object,
which is the unaltered input object.
 * This operation MUST fail if the keyConditionExpression compares a source field with anything but equality.
 * This operation MUST fail if the FilterExpressions uses a source field with anything but `=`, `IN`,
 `attribute_exists`, `attribute_not_exists` or `size`.
 * This operation MUST fail if the input FilterExpression or keyConditionExpression directly mention
 an attribute name beginning with the `Gazelle Prefix`
 * If the FilterExpression refers to no source fields, the FilterExpression MUST remain unchanged.
 * If the FilterExpression refers to source fields only with `attribute_exists`, `attribute_not_exists` or `size`,
the FilterExpression MUST be returned unchanged.

and is used with the `=` or `IN` operators,
this operation MUST replace source fields and values with scan beacon fields and HMACs
 * For each source field in the FilterExpression that is a modified scan beacon, this operation MUST replace `(field EQ value)` with `((beacon_field EQ prev_beacon_value) OR (beacon_field EQ beacon_value))` and replace `field IN(A, B)` with `beacon_field IN (beacon_A, beacon_B) OR beacon_field in (prev_beacon_A, prev_beacon_B)`.

The particulatrs of the keyConditionExpression determine the number of QueryInput objects returned.

 * If the keyConditionExpression refers to no modifed scan beacons,
this opertion must return exactly one QueryInput object.
 * If the keyConditionExpression refers to one modifed scan beacon,
this opertion MUST return two QueryInput objects;
one with the keyConditionExpression's field and value replaced with the current scan beacon settings
and one with the keyConditionExpression's field and value replaced with the previous scan beacon settings
 * If the keyConditionExpression refers to two modifed scan beacons,
this opertion MUST return between two and four QueryInput objects, replacing the keyConditionExpression's field and value with
 *
    1. previous partition pey, previous sort key
    2. previous partition pey, current sort key
    3. current partition pey, previous sort key
    4. current partition pey, current sort key
 * If either scan beacon lacks a version number,
this operation MUST return all four QueryInput objects
 * If the two version numbers are equal,
this operation MUST return only the first and last QueryInput objects
 * If the partition key version is less than the sort key version,
this operation MUST return only QueryInput objects 1, 2 and 4
 * If the partition key version is greater than the sort key version,
this operation MUST return only QueryInput objects 1, 3 and 4


#### Note : transformQueryOutput needs a QueryInput object, becase we need to check the result records against the values searched in the QueryInput object, which are not directly available in the QueryOutput object.

### transformQueryOutput
 * This operation MUST take as input a QueryOutput object and a QueryInput object
 * The QueryInput object MUST be assumed to be the origial query, not one of the results of transformQueryInput
 * This operation MUST return an QueryOutput object.
 * This operation MUST remove any records for which the original QueryInput does not match, that is,
if the original FilterExpression included `Src EQ "foo"` (where `Src` is a source field)
then this operation must remove any record in which the  `Src` field contains something other than "foo".
 * This operation MUST return all records that match the original QueryInput.

### mergeQueryOutput
 * This operation MUST take as input two QueryOutput objects
 * This operation MUST return a single QueryOutput object
 * The ConsumedCapacity of the result must contain the sum of the corresponding numbers in the two sources.
 * The Count and ScannedCount fields of the result must contain the sum of the corresponding numbers in the two sources.
 * The Items of the result must be the concatenation of the lists in the two sources
 * If either input contains a LastEvaluatedKey field, that field must appear in the output
 * If both inputs contain a LastEvaluatedKey field, this opertion MUST return an error.

### transformScanInput
 * This operation MUST take as input a ScanInput object.
 * This operation MUST return a ScanInput object.
 * If no source fields are mentioned, this operation MUST return the unaltered input object,
 * This operation MUST fail if the FilterExpressions uses a source field with anything but `=`, `IN`,
 `attribute_exists`, `attribute_not_exists` or `size`.
 * This operation MUST fail if the input FilterExpression directly mentions
 an attribute name beginning with the `Gazelle Prefix`
 * If the FilterExpression refers to source fields only with `attribute_exists`, `attribute_not_exists` or `size`,
this operation MUST return the unaltered input object.
 * For each source field in the Filter Expression that is not a modified scan beacon,
and is used with the `=` or `IN` operators,
this operation MUST replace source fields and values with scan beacon fields and HMACs
 * For each source field in the FilterExpression that is a modified scan beacon, this operation MUST replace `(field EQ value)` with `((beacon_field EQ prev_beacon_value) OR (beacon_field EQ beacon_value))` and replace `field IN(A, B)` with `beacon_field IN (beacon_A, beacon_B) OR beacon_field in (prev_beacon_A, prev_beacon_B)`
 * For each source field in the Filter Expression that is used with the `=` or `IN` operators,
the original search value must be saved in the ExecutionAttributes of the returned ScanInput object.

### transformScanOutput
 * This operation MUST take as input a ScanOutput object and a ScanInput object.
 * This operation MUST return an ScanOutput object.
 * The ScanInput object MUST be assumed to be the result of transformScanInput call, not the original ScanInput,
and so the original search values will be saved in the ExecutionAttributes of the ScanInput object.
 * This operation MUST remove any records for which the original QueryInput does not match, that is,
if the original FilterExpression included `Src EQ "foo"` (where `Src` is a source field)
then this operation must remove any record in which the  `Src` field contains something other than "foo".
 * This operation MUST return all records that match the original ScanInput.


## Operational Considerations
Fully supporting FilterExpressions, will require a complete parsing of the FilterExpression,
which is sensitive to any updates that the DynamoDB team makes to the expression language.
