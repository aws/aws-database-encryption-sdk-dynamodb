### Changelog

## Definitions

 * source field : an encrypted DynamoDB attribute
 * scan beacon field : an attribute holding the truncated HMAC of a source field

### Conventions used in this document

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

Scan beacons are described [here](scan-beacons.md)

### Overview

A `DynamoDBTableEncryptionConfig` object provides the list of Scan Beacons for the table associated with an operation.
Various Request and Response objects are transformed, based on these Scan Beacons.

It should be noted that primary keys cannot be scan beacons,
both because primary keys are not encrypted
and because scan becaons are designed to create false duplicates.

The basic user experience is this 
1. User constructs a client object, registering Gazelle intercepts
2. User calls client methods as normal*
3. Gazelle interceptors call one of the below functions to transform a request, then encrypts the request as necessary.
4. Gazelle interceptors decrypts the response as necessary, then call one of the functions below to transform the response.
5. User recieves the reposnse.

* Except for query; where instead of client.query(request) the user must call GazelleQuery(client, request)

#### Indexing

When a request is made to create a Index for a source field,
instead the index must be created on the scan beacon field.

When the config changes, a special API call must be made to create any necessary additional indexes.

#### Writing

Whenever a record is written, if the source field is written then the scan beacon field must also be written,
containing the Scan Beacon Hash of the plain text of the source field.
That is, for every encrypted attribute with a scan beacon, an additonal attribute is written.

It is a error to attempt to write a source attribute with the same name as a scan beacon field.

#### Reading

To retrieve a record based on the value of an encrypted source field,
search instead for the hash of the value in the scan beacon field.

Note that only exact matches can be supported. No ranged queries or inequalities.
It is an error to attempt such a query.

This might return false positive results. After retrieving records in this way,
you examine the decrypted record and compare the source field value to the query value,
and discard any records where they don't match.

## Operations

#### Note : The object types below are referred to by the Dafny names generated by Polymorph

### transformCreateTableInput

 * This operation MUST take a CreateTableInput object as input.
 * This operation MUST return a CreateTableInput object.
 * If no Global Secondary Index is being created, the CreateTableInput object MUST be returned unaltered.
 * If the Global Secondary Index being created includes no source fields, that is,
if the KeySchema does not mention a source field, the CreateTableInput object MUST be returned unaltered.
 * If the Global Secondary Index being created includes a source field,
the returned CreateTableInput object MUST replace the source field names
with the corresponding scan beacon field names in the KeySchema.

### transformUpdateTableInput

 * This operation MUST take as input an UpdateTableInput object.
 * This operation MUST return an UpdateTableInput object.
 * If no Global Secondary Index is being created, the UpdateTableInput object MUST be returned unaltered.
 * If the Global Secondary Index being created includes no source fields, that is,
if the KeySchema does not mention a source field, the UpdateTableInput object MUST be returned unaltered.
 * If the Global Secondary Index being created includes a source field,
the returned UpdateTableInput object MUST replace the source field names with the corresponding scan beacon field names in the KeySchema.

### transformPutItemInput
 * This operation MUST take as input an PutItemInput object.
 * This operation MUST return an PutItemInput object.
 * For each source field being written, the returned PutItemInput MUST also write the scan beacon field.
 * An error MUST be returned if a scan beacon field is used in the input PutItemInput.

### transformBatchWriteItemInput
 * This operation MUST take as input a BatchWriteItemInput object.
 * This operation MUST return a BatchWriteItemInput object.
 * For each source field being written, the returned BatchWriteItemInput MUST also write the scan beacon field.
 * An error MUST be returned if a scan beacon field is used in the input BatchWriteItemInput.

### transformTransactWriteItemsInput
 * This operation MUST take as input a TransactWriteItemsInput object.
 * This operation MUST return a TransactWriteItemsInput object.
 * For each source field being written, the returned TransactWriteItemsInput MUST also write the scan beacon field.
 * An error MUST be returned if a scan beacon field is used in the input TransactWriteItemsInput.

#### Note : GetItem, BatchGetItem and TransactGetItems work only on Primary Keys, and therefore are not affected by scan beacons

#### Note PartiQL based methods (executeStatement, batchExecuteStatement, executeTransaction) are beyond the scope of this document.

#### Note : UpdateItem is not allowed in the encryption client, and so can be ignored for scan beacons

### transformQueryInput
 * This operation MUST take as input a QueryInput object.
 * This operation MUST return a list of QueryInput objects
 * If no source fields are mentioned, this operstion MUST return a single QueryInput object,
which is the unaltered input object.
 * This operation MUST fail if the keyConditionExpression compares a source field with anything but equality.
 * This operation MUST fail if the FilterExpressions uses a source field with anything but `=`, `IN`,
 `attribute_exists`, `attribute_not_exists` or `size`.
 * This operation MUST fail if the input FilterExpression or keyConditionExpression directly mentions a scan beacon field.
 * If the FilterExpression refers to no source fields, the FilterExpression MUST remain unchanged.
 * If the FilterExpression refers to source fields only with `attribute_exists`, `attribute_not_exists` or `size`,
the FilterExpression MUST be returned unchanged.
 * For source fields in the Filter Expression that have no "previous" entry, this operation MUST replace source fields and values with scan beacon fields and HMACs
 * For source fields in the FilterExpression that do have a "previous" entry, this operation MUST replace `(field EQ value)` with `((prev_beacon_field EQ prev_beacon_value) OR (beacon_field EQ beacon_value))` and replace `field IN(A, B)` with `beacon_field IN (beacon_A, beacon_B) OR prev_beacon_field in (prev_beacon_A, prev_beacon_B).

 * If the keyConditionExpression refers to no source fields with "previous" entries,
this opertion must return exactly one QueryInput object.
 * If the keyConditionExpression refers to one source fields with a "previous" entry,
this opertion MUST return two QueryInput objects;
one with the keyConditionExpression's field and value replaced with the current scan beacon settings
and one with the keyConditionExpression's field and value replaced with the previous scan beacon settings
 * If the keyConditionExpression refers to two source fields with "previous" entries,
this opertion MUST return four QueryInput objects, replacing the keyConditionExpression's field and value
with all four permutations of current an previous settings.
 * If the implementation knows that any of the created keyConditionExpressions will return no results,
this operation MAY not return the associated QueryInput objects.

#### Note : transformQueryOutput needs a QueryInput object, becase we need to check the result records against the values searched in the QueryInput object, which are not directly available in the QueryOutput object.

### transformQueryOutput
 * This operation MUST take as input a QueryOutput object and a QueryInput object and and optional second QueryOutput object.
 * This operation MUST return an QueryOutput object.
 * If the optional second QueryOutput object is provided, the two QueryOutput objects must be merged into the returned object,
removing any duplicate results.
 * This operation MUST remove any records for which the original QueryInput does not match, that is,
if the original FilterExpression included `Src EQ "foo"` (where `Src` is a source field)
then we might get results where the `Src` field contains something other than "foo" (because false positives are expected).

### transformScanInput
 * This operation MUST take as input a ScanInput object.
 * This operation MUST return a ScanInput object.
 * This operation MUST fail if a source field is compared with anything but equality
 * If no source fields are mentioned in the FilterExpression, the ScanInput object MUST be returned unchanged.

 * For beacons in the FilterExpression that have no "previous" entry,
this operation MUST replace source fields and values with scan beacon fields and HMACs
 * For beacons in the FilterExpression that do have a "previous" entry,
this operation MUST replace `field EQ value` with `(prev_beacon_field EQ prev_beacon_value) OR (beacon_field EQ beacon_value)`

#### Note : transformScanOutput needs a ScanInput object, becase we need to check the result records against the values searched in the ScanInput object, which are not directly available in the QueryOutput object.

### transformScanOutput
 * This operation MUST take as input a ScanOutput object and a ScanInput object.
 * This operation MUST return an ScanOutput object.
 * This operation MUST remove any records for which the original QueryInput does not match, that is,
if the original FilterExpression included `Src EQ "foo"` (where `Src` is a source field)
then we might get results where the `Src` field contains something other than "foo" (because false positives are expected).
Those results must be removed. 


## Operational Considerations
Fully supporting FilterExpressions, will require a complete parsing of the FilterExpression,
which is sensitive to any updates that the DynamoDB team makes to the expression language.
