# AWS Database Encryption SDK for DynamoDB in Java

The AWS Database Encryption SDK (DB-ESDK) for DynamoDB in Java is a client-side encryption 
library that allows you to perform attribute-level encryption, enabling you to encrypt specific 
attribute values within items before storing them in your DynamoDB table. All encryption and 
decryption are performed within your application. This lets you protect sensitive data in-transit 
and at-rest, as data cannot be exposed unless decrypted by your application.

For more details about the design and architecture of the DB-ESDK for DynamoDB, 
see the [AWS Database Encryption SDK Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/database-encryption-sdk/latest/devguide/).

# Getting Started

## Required Prerequisites
To use the DB-ESDK for DynamoDB in Java, you must have:

* **A Java 8 or newer development environment**
  If you do not have one, 
  go to [Java SE Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) on the Oracle website, 
  then download and install the Java SE Development Kit (JDK). 
  Java 8 or higher is required.

  **Note:** If you use the Oracle JDK, 
  you must also download and install 
  the [Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html).

* **Declare a Dependency on the DB-ESDK for DynamoDB in Java and it's dependencies**  
  This library requires the DynamoDB client
  from the AWS SDK for Java V2
  and the AwsCryptographicMaterialProviders library.

  The KMS and DynamoDB-Enhanced Clients from the AWS SDK For Java V2
  are **optional** dependencies.

  * **Via Gradle Kotlin**  
   In a Gradle Java Project, add the following to the _dependencies_ section:
   ```kotlin
   implementation("software.amazon.cryptography:aws-database-encryption-sdk-dynamodb:3.1.1")
   implementation("software.amazon.cryptography:aws-cryptographic-material-providers:1.0.0")
   implementation(platform("software.amazon.awssdk:bom:2.19.1"))
   implementation("software.amazon.awssdk:dynamodb")
   // The following are optional:
   implementation("software.amazon.awssdk:dynamodb-enhanced")
   implementation("software.amazon.awssdk:kms")
   ```

  * **Via Apache Maven**  
  Add the following to your project's `pom.xml`.
  ```xml
  <project>
  ...
  <dependencyManagement>
   <dependencies>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>software.amazon.awssdk</groupId>
        <artifactId>bom</artifactId>
        <version>2.19.1</version>
        <type>pom</type>
        <scope>import</scope>
      </dependency>
   </dependencies>
  </dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>software.amazon.awssdk</groupId>
      <artifactId>dynamodb</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>software.amazon.cryptography</groupId>
      <artifactId>aws-database-encryption-sdk-dynamodb</artifactId>
      <version>3.1.1</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>software.amazon.cryptography</groupId>
      <artifactId>aws-cryptographic-material-providers</artifactId>
      <version>1.0.0</version>
    </dependency>
    <!-- The following are optional -->
    <dependency>
      <groupId>software.amazon.awssdk</groupId>
      <artifactId>dynamodb-enhanced</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>software.amazon.awssdk</groupId>
      <artifactId>kms</artifactId>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
  ...
  </project>
  ```

### AWS Integration
You need an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account to use the DB-ESDK for DynamoDB as it's specifically designed to work with Amazon DynamoDB. Optionally, you can use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) as your main keyring provider.

* **To create an AWS account**, go to 
  [Sign In or Create an AWS Account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html)
  and then choose **I am a new user.**  
  Follow the instructions to create an AWS account.

* **(Optional) To create a key in AWS KMS**, see
  [Creating Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html).

### Amazon Corretto Crypto Provider
Many developers find that the Amazon Corretto Crypto Provider (ACCP)
significantly improves the performance of the library.
For help installing and using ACCP, see the 
[amazon-corretto-crypto-provider repository](https://github.com/corretto/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider).

## Using the DB-ESDK for DynamoDB in Java
There are several ways to use the library.  
More details are provided in the
[AWS Database Encryption SDK Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/database-encryption-sdk/latest/devguide/).  
Also see the [Examples](Examples/runtimes/java/DynamoDbEncryption).
