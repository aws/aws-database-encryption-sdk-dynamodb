# AWS Database Encryption SDK for DynamoDB

ðŸ“£ Note: This repository contains the source code and related files for all
language implementations of the AWS Database Encryption SDK for DynamoDB.
See our [supported languages](#supported-languages) section for more information.

The AWS Database Encryption SDK (DB-ESDK) for DynamoDB is a client-side encryption
library that allows you to perform attribute-level encryption, enabling you to encrypt specific
attribute values within items before storing them in your DynamoDB table. All encryption and
decryption are performed within your application. This lets you protect sensitive data in-transit
and at-rest, as data cannot be exposed unless decrypted by your application.

For more details about the design and architecture of the DB-ESDK for DynamoDB,
see the [AWS Database Encryption SDK Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/database-encryption-sdk/latest/devguide/).

# Getting Started

### Repository structure

This repository is a top level repository which houses all source code in order to compile this library into
different runtimes.

This library is written in Dafny, a formally verifiable programming language that can be compiled into
different runtimes. This library is currently **ONLY** supported in Java and .NET

### AWS Integration

You need an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account to use the DB-ESDK for DynamoDB as it's specifically designed to work with Amazon DynamoDB. Optionally, you can use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) as your main keyring provider.

- **To create an AWS account**, go to
  [Sign In or Create an AWS Account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html)
  and then choose **I am a new user.**  
  Follow the instructions to create an AWS account.

- **(Optional) To create a key in AWS KMS**, see
  [Creating Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html).
