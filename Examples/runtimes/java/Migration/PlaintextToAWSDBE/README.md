# DyanmoDb Encryption Client to AWS Database Encryption SDK for DynamoDb Migration

This projects demonstrates the steps necessary
to migrate to the AWS Database Encryption SDK for DynamoDb
from a plaintext database.

[Step 0](Desktop/workplace/aws-dynamodb-encryption-dafny/Examples/runtimes/java/Migration/PlaintextToAWSDBE/DDBEC/README.md) demonstrates the starting state for your system.

## Step 1

In Step 1, you update your system to do the following:

- continue to read plaintext items
- continue to write plaintext items
- prepare to read encrypted items

When you deploy changes in Step 1,
you should not expect any behavior change in your system,
and your dataset still consists of plaintext data.

You must ensure that the changes in Step 1 make it to all your readers before you proceed to Step 2.

## Step 2

In Step 2, you update your system to do the following:

- continue to read plaintext items
- start writing encrypted items
- continue to read encrypted items

When you deploy changes in Step 2,
you are introducing encrypted items to your system,
and must make sure that all your readers are updated with the changes from Step 1.

Before you move onto the next step, you will need to encrypt all plaintext items in your dataset.
Once you have completed this step,
while new items are being encrypted using the new format and will be authenticated on read,
your system will still accept reading plaintext, unauthenticated items.
In order to complete migration to a system where you always authenticate your items,
you should prioritize moving on to Step 3.

## Step 3

Once all old items are encrypted,
update your system to do the following:

- continue to write encrypted items
- continue to read encrypted items
- do not accept reading plaintext items

Once you have deployed these changes to your system, you have completed migration.
