  This example demonstrates how to use a shared cache across multiple Hierarchical Keyrings.
  With this functionality, users only need to maintain one common shared cache across multiple
  Hierarchical Keyrings with different Key Stores instances/KMS Clients/KMS Keys.

  There are three important parameters that users need to carefully set while providing the shared cache:

  1. Partition ID - Partition ID is an optional parameter provided to the Hierarchical Keyring input,
  which distinguishes Cryptographic Material Providers (i.e: Keyrings) writing to a cache.
  - If the Partition ID is set and is the same for two Hierarchical Keyrings (or another Material Provider),
    they CAN share the same cache entries in the cache.
  - If the Partition ID is set and is different for two Hierarchical Keyrings (or another Material Provider),
    they CANNOT share the same cache entries in the cache.
  - If the Partition ID is not set by the user, it is initialized as a random 16-byte UUID which makes
    it unique for every Hierarchical Keyring, and two Hierarchical Keyrings (or another Material Provider)
    CANNOT share the same cache entries in the cache.

  2. Logical Key Store Name - This parameter is set by the user when configuring the Key Store for
  the Hierarchical Keyring. This is a logical name for the branch key store.
  Suppose you have a physical Key Store (K). You create two instances of K (K1 and K2). Now, you create
  two Hierarchical Keyrings (HK1 and HK2) with these Key Store instances (K1 and K2 respectively).
  - If you want to share cache entries across these two keyrings, you should set the Logical Key Store Names
    for both the Key Store instances (K1 and K2) to be the same.
  - If you set the Logical Key Store Names for K1 and K2 to be different, HK1 (which uses Key Store instance K1)
    and HK2 (which uses Key Store instance K2) will NOT be able to share cache entries.

  3. Branch Key ID - Choose an effective Branch Key ID Schema

  This is demonstrated in the example below.
  Notice that both K1 and K2 are instances of the same physical Key Store (K).
  You MUST NEVER have two different physical Key Stores with the same Logical Key Store Name.

  Important Note: If you have two or more Hierarchy Keyrings with:
  - Same Partition ID
  - Same Logical Key Store Name of the Key Store for the Hierarchical Keyring 
  - Same Branch Key ID
  then they WILL share the cache entries in the Shared Cache.
  Please make sure that you set all of Partition ID, Logical Key Store Name and Branch Key ID
  to be the same for two Hierarchical Keyrings if and only if you want them to share cache entries.

  This example sets up DynamoDb Encryption for the AWS SDK client using the Hierarchical
  Keyring, which establishes a key hierarchy where "branch" keys are persisted in DynamoDb.
  These branch keys are used to protect your data keys, and these branch keys are themselves
  protected by a root KMS Key.

  This example first creates a shared cache that you can use across multiple Hierarchical Keyrings.
  The example then configures a Hierarchical Keyring (HK1 and HK2) with the shared cache,
  a Branch Key ID and two instances (K1 and K2) of the same physical Key Store (K) respectively,
  i.e. HK1 with K1 and HK2 with K2. The example demonstrates that if you set the same Partition ID
  for HK1 and HK2, the two keyrings can share cache entries.
  If you set different Partition ID of the Hierarchical Keyrings, or different
  Logical Key Store Names of the Key Store instances, then the keyrings will NOT
  be able to share cache entries.

  Running this example requires access to the DDB Table whose name
  is provided in CLI arguments.
  This table must be configured with the following
  primary key configuration:
    - Partition key is named "partition_key" with type (S)
    - Sort key is named "sort_key" with type (S)

  This example also requires using a KMS Key whose ARN
  is provided in CLI arguments. You need the following access
  on this key:
    - GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext
    - Decrypt

        //     when all unauthenticated data is easily distinguishable by their attribute name.
        //   - If you need to add new unauthenticated attributes in the future,

        //     any other configuration update needed.
        //   Once you configure this field, it is not safe to update it.
        //
        // - Configure `allowedUnsignedAttributes`: You may also explicitly list
        //   a set of attributes that should be considered unauthenticated when encountered
        //   on read. Be careful if you use this configuration. Do not remove an attribute
        //   name from this configuration, even if you are no longer writing with that attribute,
        //   as old items may still include this attribute, and our configuration needs to know
        //   to continue to exclude this attribute from the signature scope.
        //   If you add new attribute names to this field, you must first deploy the update to this
