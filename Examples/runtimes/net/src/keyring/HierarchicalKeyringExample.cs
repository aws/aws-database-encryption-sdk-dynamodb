/*
  This example sets up DynamoDb Encryption for the AWS SDK client
  using the Hierarchical Keyring, which establishes a key hierarchy
  where "branch" keys are persisted in DynamoDb.
  These branch keys are used to protect your data keys,
  and these branch keys are themselves protected by a root KMS Key.

  Establishing a key hierarchy like this has two benefits:

  First, by caching the branch key material, and only calling back
  to KMS to re-establish authentication regularly according to your configured TTL,
  you limit how often you need to call back to KMS to protect your data.
  This is a performance/security tradeoff, where your authentication, audit, and
  logging from KMS is no longer one-to-one with every encrypt or decrypt call.
  However, the benefit is that you no longer have to make a
  network call to KMS for every encrypt or decrypt.

  Second, this key hierarchy makes it easy to hold multi-tenant data
  that is isolated per branch key in a single DynamoDb table.
  You can create a branch key for each tenant in your table,
  and encrypt all that tenant's data under that distinct branch key.
  On decrypt, you can either statically configure a single branch key
  to ensure you are restricting decryption to a single tenant,
  or you can implement an interface that lets you map the primary key on your items
  to the branch key that should be responsible for decrypting that data.

  This example then demonstrates configuring a Hierarchical Keyring
  with a Branch Key ID Supplier to encrypt and decrypt data for
  two separate tenants.

  Running this example requires access to the DDB Table whose name
  is provided in CLI arguments.
  This table must be configured with the following
  primary key configuration:
    - Partition key is named "partition_key" with type (S)
    - Sort key is named "sort_key" with type (S)

  This example also requires using a KMS Key whose ARN
  is provided in CLI arguments. You need the following access
  on this key:
    - GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext
    - Decrypt

        //    For each attribute that may exist on the items we plan to write to our DynamoDbTable,
        //    we must explicitly configure how they should be treated during item encryption:
        //      - ENCRYPT_AND_SIGN: The attribute is encrypted and included in the signature
        //      - SIGN_ONLY: The attribute not encrypted, but is still included in the signature
        //      - DO_NOTHING: The attribute is not encrypted and not included in the signature

        {
            ["partition_key"] = CryptoAction.SIGN_ONLY, // Our partition attribute must be SIGN_ONLY

        // 5. Configure which attributes we expect to be included in the signature
        //    when reading items. There are two options for configuring this:
        //
        //    - (Recommended) Configure `allowedUnsignedAttributesPrefix`:
        //      When defining your DynamoDb schema and deciding on attribute names,
        //      choose a distinguishing prefix (such as ":") for all attributes that
        //      you do not want to include in the signature.
        //      This has two main benefits:
        //      - It is easier to reason about the security and authenticity of data within your item
        //        when all unauthenticated data is easily distinguishable by their attribute name.
        //      - If you need to add new unauthenticated attributes in the future,
        //        you can easily make the corresponding update to your `attributeActionsOnEncrypt`
        //        and immediately start writing to that new attribute, without
        //        any other configuration update needed.
        //      Once you configure this field, it is not safe to update it.
        //
        //    - Configure `allowedUnsignedAttributes`: You may also explicitly list
        //      a set of attributes that should be considered unauthenticated when encountered
        //      on read. Be careful if you use this configuration. Do not remove an attribute
        //      name from this configuration, even if you are no longer writing with that attribute,
        //      as old items may still include this attribute, and our configuration needs to know
        //      to continue to exclude this attribute from the signature scope.
        //      If you add new attribute names to this field, you must first deploy the update to this
        //      field to all readers in your host fleet before deploying the update to start writing
        //      with that new attribute.
        //
        //   For this example, we currently authenticate all attributes. To make it easier to
        //   add unauthenticated attributes in the future, we define a prefix ":" for such attributes.
