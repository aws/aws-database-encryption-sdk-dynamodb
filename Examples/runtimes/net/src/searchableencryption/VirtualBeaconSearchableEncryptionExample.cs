  This example demonstrates how to set up a virtual field from two DDB
  attributes, create a standard beacon with that field, put an item with
  that beacon, and query against that beacon.

  A virtual field is a field consisting of a transformation of one or more attributes in a DDB item.
  Virtual fields are useful in querying against encrypted fields that only have a handful of
  possible values. They allow you to take fields with few possible values, concatenate
  them to other fields, then query against the combined field. This enables using these types of
  fields in queries while making it infeasible to identify which beacon values encode
  the few possible distinct plaintexts. This is explained in more detail below.
  Virtual fields are not stored in the DDB table. However, they are used to construct
  a beacon, the value of which is stored.

  For more information on virtual fields, see
    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/database-encryption-sdk/latest/devguide/beacons.html#virtual-field

  For our example, we will construct a virtual field
  from two DDB attributes `state` and `hasTestResult` as `state`+prefix(`hasTestResult`, 1).
  We will then create a beacon out of this virtual field and use it to search.

  This example follows a use case of a database that stores customer test result metadata.
  Records are indexed by `customer_id` and store a `state` attribute, representing the
  US state or territory where the customer lives, and a `hasTestResult` boolean attribute,
  representing whether the customer has a "test result" available. (Maybe this represents
  some medical test result, and this table stores "result available" metadata.) We assume
  that values in these fields are uniformly distributed across all possible values for
  these fields (56 for `state`, 2 for `hasTestResult`), and are uniformly distributed across
  customer IDs.

  The motivation behind this example is to demonstrate how and why one would use a virtual beacon.
  In this example, our table stores records with an encrypted boolean `hasTestResult` attribute.
  We would like to be able to query for customers in a given state with a `true` hasTestResult
  attribute.

  To be able to execute this query securely and efficiently, we want the following
  properties on our table:
   1. Hide the distribution of `hasTestResult` attribute values (i.e. it should be infeasible
      to determine the percentage of `true`s to `false`s across the dataset from beaconized
      values)
   2. Query against a combination of whether `hasTestResult` is true/false and the `state` field
  We cannot achieve these properties with a standard beacon on a true/false attribute. Following
  the guidance to choose a beacon length:
    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/database-encryption-sdk/latest/devguide/choosing-beacon-length.html
  For a boolean value (in our case, whether `hasTestResult` is true or false), the acceptable
  bounds for beacon length are either 0 or 1. This corresponds to either not storing a beacon
  (length 0), or effectively storing another boolean attribute (length 1). With
  length 0, this beacon is useless for searching (violating property 2); with length 1, this
  beacon may not hide the attribute (violating property 1).
  In addition, choosing a longer beacon length does not help us.
  Each attribute value is mapped to a distinct beacon.
  Since booleans only have 2 possible attribute values, we will still only have 2 possible
  beacon values, though those values may be longer. A longer beacon provides no advantages over
  beacon of length 1 in this situation.

  A compound beacon also does not help.
  To (over)simplify, a compound beacon is a concatenation of standard beacons,
  i.e. beacon(`state`)+beacon(`hasTestResult`).
  The `hasTestResult` beacon is still visible, so we would still have the problems above.

  To achieve these properties, we instead construct a virtual field and use that in our beacon,
  i.e. beacon(`state`+`hasTestResult`). Assuming these fields are well-distributed across
  customer IDs and possible values, this gives us both desired properties; we can query against
  both attributes while hiding information from the underlying data. This is demonstrated in more
  detail below.

  Running this example requires access to a DDB table  with the
  following primary key configuration:
    - Partition key is named "customer_id" with type (S)
    - Sort key is named "create_time" with type (S)
  This table must have a Global Secondary Index (GSI) configured named "stateAndHasTestResult-index":
    - Partition key is named "aws_dbe_b_stateAndHasTestResult" with type (S)

  In this example for storing customer location data, this schema is utilized for the data:
   - "customer_id" stores a unique customer identifier
   - "create_time" stores a Unix timestamp
   - "state" stores an encrypted 2-letter US state or territory abbreviation
         (https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/cnt_html/appendix_a.html)
   - "hasTestResult" is not part of the schema, but is an attribute utilized in this example.
      It stores a boolean attribute (false/true) indicating whether this customer has a test result
      available.

  The example requires the following ordered input command line parameters:
    1. DDB table name for table to put/query data from
    2. Branch key ID for a branch key that was previously created in your key store. See the
       CreateKeyStoreKeyExample.
    2. Branch key wrapping KMS key ARN for the KMS key used to create the branch key
    3. Branch key DDB table name for the DDB table representing the branch key store

        //     - max: log((112/2))/log(2) ~= 5.8, round up to 6
        //    You will somehow need to round results to a nearby integer.
        //    We choose to round to the nearest integer; you might consider a different rounding approach.

        //       leading to fewer decrypt calls and better performance,

        //       but it is harder to identify which beacon values encode distinct plaintexts.
        //    We can choose a beacon length between 3 and 6:
        //     - Closer to 3, we expect more "false positives" to be returned,
        //       making it harder to identify which beacon values encode distinct plaintexts,

        //      - keyStore: The keystore configured in the previous step.
