/*
  This example demonstrates how to set up a compound beacon on encrypted attributes,
      put an item with the beacon, and query against that beacon.
  This example follows a use case of a database that stores unit inspection information.
      This is an extension of the "BasicSearchableEncryptionExample" in this directory.
      This example uses the same situation (storing unit inspection information)
      and the same table schema.
  However, this example uses a different Global Secondary Index (GSI)
      that is based on a compound beacon configuration composed of
      the `last4` and `unit` attributes.

  Running this example requires access to a DDB table with the
  following key configuration:
    - Partition key is named "work_id" with type (S)
    - Sort key is named "inspection_time" with type (S)
  This table must have a Global Secondary Index (GSI) configured named "last4UnitCompound-index":
    - Partition key is named "aws_dbe_b_last4UnitCompound" with type (S)

  In this example for storing unit inspection information, this schema is utilized for the data:
   - "work_id" stores a unique identifier for a unit inspection work order (v4 UUID)
   - "inspection_date" stores an ISO 8601 date for the inspection (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - "inspector_id_last4" stores the last 4 digits of the ID of the inspector performing the work
   - "unit" stores a 12-digit serial number for the unit being inspected

  The example requires the following ordered input command line parameters:
    1. DDB table name for table to put/query data from
    2. Branch key ID for a branch key that was previously created in your key store. See the
       CreateKeyStoreKeyExample.
    3. Branch key wrapping KMS key ARN for the KMS key used to create the branch key with ID
       provided in arg 2
    4. Branch key DDB table ARN for the DDB table representing the branch key store

        //    See that file to see details on beacon construction and parameters.
        //    While we will not directly query against these beacons,
        //      you must create standard beacons on encrypted fields
        //      that we wish to use in compound beacons.
        var standardBeaconList = new List<StandardBeacon>();

            Name = "inspector_id_last4",

        // 2. Define encrypted parts.
        //    Encrypted parts define the beacons that can be used to construct a compound beacon,
        //        and how the compound beacon prefixes those beacon values.
        var encryptedPartList = new List<EncryptedPart>();
        // A encrypted part must receive:
        //  - name: Name of a standard beacon
        //  - prefix: Any string. This is plaintext that prefixes the beaconized value in the compound beacon.
        //            Prefixes must be unique across the configuration, and must not be a prefix of another prefix;
        //            i.e. for all configured prefixes, the first N characters of a prefix must not equal another prefix.
        // In practice, it is suggested to have a short value distinguishable from other parts served on the prefix.
        // For this example, we will choose "L-" as the prefix for "Last 4 digits of inspector ID".
        // With this prefix and the standard beacon's bit length definition (10), the beaconized
        //     version of the inspector ID's last 4 digits will appear as
        //     `L-000` to `L-3ff` inside a compound beacon.
        var last4EncryptedPart = new EncryptedPart
        {
            Name = "inspector_id_last4",
            Prefix = "L-"
        };
        encryptedPartList.Add(last4EncryptedPart);

        // For this example, we will choose "U-" as the prefix for "unit".
        // With this prefix and the standard beacon's bit length definition (30), a unit beacon will appear
        //     as `U-00000000` to `U-3fffffff` inside a compound beacon.
        var unitEncryptedPart = new EncryptedPart
        {
            Name = "unit",
            Prefix = "U-"
        };
        encryptedPartList.Add(unitEncryptedPart);

        // 3. Define compound beacon.
        //    A compound beacon allows one to serve multiple beacons or attributes from a single index.
        //    A compound beacon must receive:
        //     - name: The name of the beacon. Compound beacon values will be written to `aws_ddb_e_[name]`.
        //     - split: A character separating parts in a compound beacon
        //    A compound beacon may also receive:
        //     - encrypted: A list of encrypted parts. This is effectively a list of beacons. We provide the list
        //                  that we created above.
        //     - constructors: A list of constructors. This is an ordered list of possible ways to create a beacon.
        //                     We have not defined any constructors here; see the complex example for how to do this.
        //                     The client will provide a default constructor, which will write a compound beacon as:
        //                     all signed parts in the order they are added to the signed list;
        //                     all encrypted parts in order they are added to the encrypted list; all parts required.
        //                     In this example, we expect compound beacons to be written as
        //                     `L-XXX.U-YYYYYYYY`, since our encrypted list looks like
        //                     [last4EncryptedPart, unitEncryptedPart].
        //     - signed: A list of signed parts, i.e. plaintext attributes. This would be provided if we
        //                     wanted to use plaintext values as part of constructing our compound beacon. We do not
