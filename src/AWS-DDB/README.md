# DDB Model

This AWS-DDB module is a work in progress, and currently requires some updates in order to successfully build a model and corresponding types with Polymorph.

## DDB Model Changes

The following changes were done to the DDB model at https://github.com/aws/aws-models/blob/master/dynamodb/smithy/model.json in order to accomodate Polymorph's current limitations:

- All `double` types were changed to `integer`. This can be changed back once Polymorph supports the smithy `double` type.

## DDB Polymorph-generated Dafny Changes

The following changes were done to the Dafny code generated by the DDB model to accomodate Polymorph's and Dafny's current limitations:

- Imports to StandardLibrary and Util were updated to a new relative path
- Any params named "Keys" or "Items" were updated to "KeyList" or "ItemList". See: https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/issues/1209
