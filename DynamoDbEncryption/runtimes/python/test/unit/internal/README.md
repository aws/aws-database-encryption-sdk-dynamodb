The test_client_to_resource.py and test_resource_to_client.py files
in this directory verify that DBESDK's boto3 resource/client conversion methods
correctly convert between resource/client shapes for all operations
supported by DBESDK.

The only shapes that require conversion are
* AttributeValues (DDB items or keys)
  * Client shape ex.: `{"S": "some string"}`
  * Resource shape ex.: `"some string"`
* ConditionExpressions (KeyConditionExpression or FilterExpression; only resource-to-client)
  * Client shape ex.:
    * KeyConditionExpression: `"attr : :value"`
    * ExpressionAttributeValues: `{":value" : {"S" : "some value}}`
  * Resource shape ex.:
    * KeyConditionExpression: `Attr("attr").eq("some value")` (also supports the client shape)

and recursive traversals from the input/output shape to those shapes.
(i.e. for boto3 Table [put_item](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/dynamodb/table/put_item.html)),
the following kwargs MUST be converted from resource shapes to client shapes:
* `["Item"]`
* `["Expected"][<table_name>]["Value"]`
* `["Expected"][<table_name>]["AttributeValueList"]`
* `["ConditionExpression"]`
* `["ExpressionAttributeValues"]`

The requests, responses, and items in the parent directory are shared between the integ tests and these unit tests.
The integ tests assert that the basic forms of these requests, responses, and items are authoritative; i.e. DynamoDB will receive/send these structures.
These tests assert

Note: The conversion logic is generated by Smithy-Dafny Python
and the shape traversals are derived from the MPL's DynamoDB Smithy model.
As a result, the correctness of this conversion logic is largely defined by the correctness of the Smithy codegen logic and the correctness of the DynamoDB Smithy model.
As a result, the amount of testing needed by these files *should* only need to be smoke testing, 
but it is more exhaustive than that
because the conversion logic was manually written at first.
